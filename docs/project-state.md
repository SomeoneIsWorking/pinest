# Project state — remote-code

Factual capability inventory. IDs are stable. Statuses: `verified` (evidence
cited), `partial`, `blocked`, `missing`. One current focus at the bottom.
Atomic work and findings live in `docs/issues/`.

## S1 — PiNest extension ported and loading under pi

Status: `verified`

Ported to `server/` in erasable TypeScript; loads and routes against a
stubbed pi API (`npm test`, extension-load + manifest suites). Fixed during
the port: start-script path, missing `listPaths` implementation, package.json
bin/build, WS auth double-`.uid` bug, nonexistent `_broadcastState` on client
connect (now `setStateProvider`), host `cancel` silent no-op (abort lives on
`ExtensionContext`), Firebase init moved off the import path (missing service
account no longer crashes the pi host).

Evidence: `cd server && npm test` — 153 tests, 0 fail; `npm run typecheck`
clean. Real-host smoke (pi 0.84.3): `pi -e server/src/index.ts` loads the
extension via jiti; `/rc-sessions` executes and answers the extension-UI
select dialog (exit-0 vs exit-1 discriminator against a bogus command and
the old /pinest-* names).
The live host also survived a real `/pinest-spawn` after the state-broadcast
recursion fix (I-009).

Fatal uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections now print their kind,
message, and full stack to the Pi terminal before the host exits (I-010).

The live host also publishes an ngrok v3 endpoint discovered through the
local ngrok API and accepts an authenticated WebSocket connection through it
(I-011).

The host restores non-closed registry sessions at startup and exposes the
server-authoritative active session selection to clients (I-013).

Gaps: one real browser sign-in to exercise the hosted RestImpl path end to end
(AdminFirebase is what runs on the dev machine today).

## S2 — Session registry persisted to disk

Status: `verified`

`server/src/registry.ts`: `PI_AGENT_DIR/remote-code/sessions.json` (env
`RC_REGISTRY_PATH`), atomic tmp+rename writes, missing file → empty,
corrupt/wrong-shape → loud `RegistryError` (never silently wiped), CRUD +
close/remove with optional history deletion.

Evidence: `server/test/registry.test.ts` — 11 tests incl. round-trip through a
fresh registry instance, corrupt-file refusal leaving the file intact, no tmp
droppings after 5 saves.

## S3 — Resume: sessions survive host restart

Status: `partial`

`Supervisor.resume()` re-opens a session via pi SDK
`createAgentSession({cwd, sessionManager: SessionManager.open(path)})`;
history restored from pi's own JSONL (seeded via pi's `appendMessage` API in
tests — no hand-written session files). Registry rows survive host exit
(`shutdownAll` parks live rows idle), despawn closes rows keeping history,
`session_resume`/`session_list`/`session_delete` WS commands landed, host
session id is now stable across restarts (registry host row).

Evidence: `server/test/resume.test.ts` — spawn → despawn → "restart" → resume
restores user+assistant history; unknown path/already-running → clear errors.
NOT yet verified: kill of a real running host (SIGKILL) + restart + resume
from the app end-to-end.

Gaps: real-host restart drill; app UI for resume (I-007).

## S4 — Harness self-modification applies live

Status: `verified`

`server/src/reload.ts` + index wiring: watcher over global/project extension
dirs, this extension's own source, and settings files (debounced 1.5s, arm
delay, `RC_NO_WATCH=1` opt-out); `/rc-reload` command calls `ctx.reload()`
after `waitForIdle`; `reload_runtime` LLM tool queues `/rc-reload` as
follow-up; `reload` WS command for the app. On reload the instance tears down
(WS/tunnel stop, spawned sessions parked idle → resumable) and the
re-imported instance bootstraps fresh.

Evidence: unit tests (`reload.test.ts` — single fire per burst, zero fires
without change, stop cancels, arm delay, missing dirs tolerated) PLUS a real
host drill (`scratch/drive-rpc.mjs`, RPC mode): touching the extension's own
source fired the watcher, `/rc-reload` executed as a command (custom message
in the event stream), the module re-imported (factory ran 2x), and the host
kept executing extension commands post-reload with zero `extension_error`.
Found + fixed by the drill: `sendUserMessage` defaults
`expandPromptTemplates: false`, which skips pi's command dispatch — the
queued "/rc-reload" would have reached the LLM as literal text; queueReload
now passes `expandPromptTemplates: true`. The watcher also no longer depends
on Firebase bootstrap succeeding.

Gaps: reload during an ACTIVE remote session (spawned sessions parking +
app reconnect) exercised end-to-end — blocked on S6.

## S5b — Hosted discovery backend (zero-config distribution)

Status: `partial`

Two Firebase backends behind `FirebaseAuth` (`server/src/auth.ts`):
HOSTED (default — our `pinest-app` project; user signs in via browser, ID
token + refresh token cached, renewals via securetoken, client-token
verification via Identity Toolkit REST, presence via Firestore REST) and
ADMIN (optional service account key, self-hosters, bypasses rules). Browser
login is gated to interactive TUI mode; headless runs resolve from cache or
fail with instructions — pinned by `test/auth.test.ts` ("opens NO browser"
assertions) plus `RC_NO_BROWSER=1` guard in `openBrowser`. After a user
report of tests opening the browser, the path was traced to the extension-
load test invoking `/pinest-auth` un-isolated; fixed (temp-dir auth env,
port-blocker for the login server) and verified: zero :8731 listeners across
the full suite.

Rules DEPLOYED to pinest-app (live release → ruleset 04f3c8ab, deployed
2026-08-28 via the Rules API with the owner's gcloud credentials; previous
pinest ruleset backed up in scratch/rules-backup/). Verified functionally
against the live project: owner write of own doc 200, cross-user write 403,
non-whitelisted field 403.

Gaps: one real browser sign-in to exercise RestImpl end-to-end (AdminFirebase
is what runs on the dev machine today).

## S5 — GLM-5.3-Flash via OpenCode Go, compact at ~400k

Status: `verified`

Endpoint + limits confirmed (models.dev: context 1,000,000, output 131,072,
`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`, OpenAI-compatible). Provisioning script not
yet written; no models.json entry shipped; settings default not wired.
Default spawn model string updated to `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` in the
meantime.

Evidence: provision ran on the dev machine (`node scripts/provision.ts` —
model ok, context 1,000,000, auth ok, idempotent second run); settings.json
now carries the compaction patch and default model. OpenRouter +
opencode-go API keys installed in the machine's pi auth store
(`PI_AGENT_DIR/auth.json`, `type: "api_key"`), so spawned sessions
authenticate without env vars; real-LLM integration tests pass against
`openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` (free tier; the gemma
free model 429-rate-limits).

## S6 — Flutter client with durable session UI

Status: `partial`

PiNest's app forked to `app/` (dead code not carried): reconnect fix landed
(WS close re-dials on the next discovery-doc heartbeat), session history UI
(`SessionHistorySheet`: registry-only sessions with resume/delete), spawn
default model `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`, and `firebase_options.dart`
checked in (public web config — pinest gitignored it, breaking fresh
clones). Verified with `flutter analyze` (0 issues) and `flutter build web`,
and deployed to `pinest-app.web.app` (deploy verified by string-match in the
served `main.dart.js`).

First real-user test against the deployed app surfaced and fixed four
defects: (1) the host `model_set` updated the label without awaiting or
checking `ExtensionAPI.setModel`'s boolean — the session stayed on
kimi-k2.6 (262,144 window) while the badge claimed GLM; now awaits,
throws on refusal, and the error reaches the app. (2) Context usage only
reached a session's tab on that session's events; `Supervisor.refreshUsage()`
now overlays live status + usage (with `compactAt`) for every live session
on each state broadcast. (3) Thinking "Default" is opencode-semantics
(`src/thinking.ts`): omit the reasoning override so the provider default
applies — for models whose `thinkingLevelMap.off` is null (glm-5.3-flash)
pi's "off" is wire-identical and is reported as `default`; explicit-off
models fall back to "medium". (4) The badge now names the model and the
auto-compact threshold so label/window mismatches are self-evident;
threshold editable in Settings (`set_compact_threshold`).

The client now persists the last selected model and thinking level locally,
uses `⌘+Enter` on macOS for sending, and exposes a per-tab edit dialog with the
workspace path and durable session renaming (I-012).

Spawn validates host directories, offers host-side folder creation, and shows
the active workspace under `~` when it belongs to the host home directory.
Session selection is server-authoritative rather than device-local (I-013).

The repository tip is publication-audited; the remaining historical findings
are being removed by the history-preserving public-repository rewrite (I-014).

Gaps: run against the live host from an actual phone; hosted (RestImpl)
backend not yet exercised by a real browser sign-in; stream deltas
(I-006 item 5) still cumulative — protocol+app change together.

## Current focus

Phone run of the app against the live host; one real browser sign-in to
exercise the hosted (RestImpl) path end-to-end.
