# Project state — remote-code

Factual capability inventory. IDs are stable. Statuses: `verified` (evidence
cited), `partial`, `blocked`, `missing`. One current focus at the bottom.
Atomic work and findings live in `docs/issues/`.

## S1 — PiNest extension ported and loading under pi

Status: `verified`

Ported to `server/` in erasable TypeScript; loads and routes against a
stubbed pi API (`npm test`, extension-load + manifest suites). Fixed during
the port: start-script path, missing `listPaths` implementation, package.json
bin/build, WS auth double-`.uid` bug, nonexistent `_broadcastState` on client
connect (now `setStateProvider`), host `cancel` silent no-op (abort lives on
`ExtensionContext`), Firebase init moved off the import path (missing service
account no longer crashes the pi host).

Evidence: `cd server && npm test` — 127 tests, 0 fail; `npm run typecheck`
clean. Real-host smoke (pi 0.84.3): `pi -e server/src/index.ts` loads the
extension via jiti; `/rc-sessions` executes and answers the extension-UI
select dialog (exit-0 vs exit-1 discriminator against a bogus command and
the old /pinest-* names).

Gaps: Firebase path exercised against the real project (needs service
account key on the host machine).

## S2 — Session registry persisted to disk

Status: `verified`

`server/src/registry.ts`: `<PI_AGENT_DIR>/remote-code/sessions.json` (env
`RC_REGISTRY_PATH`), atomic tmp+rename writes, missing file → empty,
corrupt/wrong-shape → loud `RegistryError` (never silently wiped), CRUD +
close/remove with optional history deletion.

Evidence: `server/test/registry.test.ts` — 11 tests incl. round-trip through a
fresh registry instance, corrupt-file refusal leaving the file intact, no tmp
droppings after 5 saves.

## S3 — Resume: sessions survive host restart

Status: `partial`

`Supervisor.resume()` re-opens a session via pi SDK
`createAgentSession({cwd, sessionManager: SessionManager.open(path)})`;
history restored from pi's own JSONL (seeded via pi's `appendMessage` API in
tests — no hand-written session files). Registry rows survive host exit
(`shutdownAll` parks live rows idle), despawn closes rows keeping history,
`session_resume`/`session_list`/`session_delete` WS commands landed, host
session id is now stable across restarts (registry host row).

Evidence: `server/test/resume.test.ts` — spawn → despawn → "restart" → resume
restores user+assistant history; unknown path/already-running → clear errors.
NOT yet verified: kill of a real running host (SIGKILL) + restart + resume
from the app end-to-end.

Gaps: real-host restart drill; app UI for resume (I-007).

## S4 — Harness self-modification applies live

Status: `verified`

`server/src/reload.ts` + index wiring: watcher over global/project extension
dirs, this extension's own source, and settings files (debounced 1.5s, arm
delay, `RC_NO_WATCH=1` opt-out); `/rc-reload` command calls `ctx.reload()`
after `waitForIdle`; `reload_runtime` LLM tool queues `/rc-reload` as
follow-up; `reload` WS command for the app. On reload the instance tears down
(WS/tunnel stop, spawned sessions parked idle → resumable) and the
re-imported instance bootstraps fresh.

Evidence: unit tests (`reload.test.ts` — single fire per burst, zero fires
without change, stop cancels, arm delay, missing dirs tolerated) PLUS a real
host drill (`scratch/drive-rpc.mjs`, RPC mode): touching the extension's own
source fired the watcher, `/rc-reload` executed as a command (custom message
in the event stream), the module re-imported (factory ran 2x), and the host
kept executing extension commands post-reload with zero `extension_error`.
Found + fixed by the drill: `sendUserMessage` defaults
`expandPromptTemplates: false`, which skips pi's command dispatch — the
queued "/rc-reload" would have reached the LLM as literal text; queueReload
now passes `expandPromptTemplates: true`. The watcher also no longer depends
on Firebase bootstrap succeeding.

Gaps: reload during an ACTIVE remote session (spawned sessions parking +
app reconnect) exercised end-to-end — blocked on S6.

## S5b — Hosted discovery backend (zero-config distribution)

Status: `partial`

Two Firebase backends behind `FirebaseAuth` (`server/src/auth.ts`):
HOSTED (default — our `pinest-app` project; user signs in via browser, ID
token + refresh token cached, renewals via securetoken, client-token
verification via Identity Toolkit REST, presence via Firestore REST) and
ADMIN (optional service account key, self-hosters, bypasses rules). Browser
login is gated to interactive TUI mode; headless runs resolve from cache or
fail with instructions — pinned by `test/auth.test.ts` ("opens NO browser"
assertions) plus `RC_NO_BROWSER=1` guard in `openBrowser`. After a user
report of tests opening the browser, the path was traced to the extension-
load test invoking `/pinest-auth` un-isolated; fixed (temp-dir auth env,
port-blocker for the login server) and verified: zero :8731 listeners across
the full suite.

Rules DEPLOYED to pinest-app (live release → ruleset 04f3c8ab, deployed
2026-08-28 via the Rules API with the owner's gcloud credentials; previous
pinest ruleset backed up in scratch/rules-backup/). Verified functionally
against the live project: owner write of own doc 200, cross-user write 403,
non-whitelisted field 403.

Gaps: one real browser sign-in to exercise RestImpl end-to-end (AdminFirebase
is what runs on the dev machine today).

## S5 — GLM-5.3-Flash via OpenCode Go, compact at ~400k

Status: `missing`

Endpoint + limits confirmed (models.dev: context 1,000,000, output 131,072,
`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`, OpenAI-compatible). Provisioning script not
yet written; no models.json entry shipped; settings default not wired.
Default spawn model string updated to `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` in the
meantime.

Gaps: `server/scripts/provision.ts` (I-005), settings defaults.
NOTE: OpenRouter + opencode-go API keys are now installed in the machine's
pi auth store (`<PI_AGENT_DIR>/auth.json`, `type: "api_key"`), so spawned
sessions authenticate without env vars; real-LLM integration tests pass
against `openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` (free tier;
gemma free model 429-rate-limits).

## S6 — Flutter client with durable session UI

Status: `missing`

Not started; protocol now carries `state.registry`, `session_list`,
`session_resume`, `session_delete`, `session_deleted` for it.

Gaps: fork + reconnect fix + sessions UI (I-007).

## Current focus

I-005 provisioning (compact settings + default model) → I-007 app fork.
Registry/resume verified against a real host: stable host id across reloads
observed live; rules deployed and verified.
